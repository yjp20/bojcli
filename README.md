# bojcli

BOJ cli submitter. File name has to be in the format `problem_id.ext`.

To run, use:

```
$ python3 bojcli.py file
```

Currently only supports c++ because I'm lazy, but it can be extended extremely easily. Also doesn't show the percentage while iterating through percents, but otherwise it works fine.
